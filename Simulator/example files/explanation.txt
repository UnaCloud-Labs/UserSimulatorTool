Both files that are passed by arguments to Simulator.jar have the following characteristics.

The first value before the ',' in a row specifies the duration of the load in seconds.

The second value in the row specifies the percent of memory/cpu that must be taken by the program.

The program will secuentially go through each file and execute the specified load for the specified time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

There are two example files, one loads ram (ramload) and the other loads cpu (cpuload).

They both contain the same number of rows (2).

The total duration of the simulation for both files is 40 seconds. (The two rows specify that the load must be mantained for 20s each).

The program will load the cpu to 40% for 20s.
Simultaneously, the program will load RAM to 40% for 20s.

After the first 20s are over, the program will load the CPU to 30%. Simultaneously, it will also load RAM to 50%.

After the 20s are over, the program will exit.
